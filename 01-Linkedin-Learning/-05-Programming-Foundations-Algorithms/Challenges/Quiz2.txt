1-What benefit does a linked list provide?

ans:underlying memory does not need to be contiguous
 
2-What criteria allows algorithms to execute efficiently?

ans:the scenario and available data structure types

3-In the example linear array, how are the elements referenced using index values? 

1,2,3,4,5

ans:0,1,2,3,4

4-Why are hash tables favored over arrays or linked lists?


ans:They are faster for item lookups.

5-Why are linked lists sometimes preferred over arrays?

ans:They are easier and faster to iterate sequentially.
 
6-According to the code snippet below, which element will be removed from the queue?
 

queue.append(1)
queue.append(2)
queue.append(3)
queue.append(4)
x = queue.popleft()


ans:1


7-Stacks are _____ data structures.

ans:last in, first out
 

8-How does a hash table map index values to data values?

ans:Keys are mapped to data values by using a hash to compute an index value.
 
9-Which data structure is most analogous to a dictionary?

ans:a hash table
 

 
10-What does the below code do, when working with a linked list?
 

1 new_node = Node(data)
2 new_node.set_next(self.head)
3 self.head = new_node
4 self.count += 1

ans:It add a new node and makes it the head of the list.

11-Which data structure operation would be used for an “undo” command?

ans:a stack using last-in, first-out

 
12-How many elements are in an 8 by 3 by 2 array?

ans:48
