ans:It calls itself.

2-What would the following code return for efun(8)?
 

def efun(num):
  if num==0:
  return 1
  else:
  return num * efun(num-2)
 

ans:384

3-In the following recursion, what is the breaking condition?
 

function countup(x) {
  if (x == 128)
  return
 else
  countup(x+1)
 }
 

ans:if (x == 128)

4-How is recursion implemented in functions?

ans:A function calls itself from within its own code.
